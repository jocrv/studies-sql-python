Have 3 files in Git: .env.prod, .env.staging, .env.dev


No env-related files are stored in Git


Have a single .env file in git which contains the standard production config


Have a single .env file in git which contains the standard developer config


.env file is in .gitignore, .env-sample is in Git and contains the standard developer config


.env file is in .gitignore, .env-sample is in Git and contains the standard production config
